# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Web App 🩺  

This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction Web Application** built using the **Logistic Regression algorithm**. It predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on 13 clinical input features.  

## 🌟 Key Features  
- **🤖 Model Details**:  
  - Algorithm: Logistic Regression  
  - 🧠 Training Accuracy: **85%**  
  - 📊 Testing Accuracy: **80%**  
- **💻 Web Application**: An interactive interface where users can input 13 clinical features and receive a prediction on the likelihood of heart disease.  

## 📝 Input Features  
The app takes the following 13 features as input:  
1. 👤 Age  
2. ⚧ Sex  
3. 💓 Chest pain type  
4. 💉 Resting blood pressure  
5. 🥗 Cholesterol level  
6. 🍬 Fasting blood sugar  
7. 📉 Resting electrocardiographic results  
8. 🏃‍♂️ Maximum heart rate achieved  
9. 🚨 Exercise-induced angina  
10. 📈 ST depression  
11. 🪜 Slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
12. 🔬 Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy  
13. 🧬 Thalassemia  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Backend**: Logistic Regression model implemented in Python 🐍  
- **Frontend**: Web app for user interaction (Streamlit) 🌐  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, and others for data processing and modeling 📚  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. 🖊️ Input the required 13 features into the web app.  
2. 🖱️ Click on "Heart Disease test result" to get the result.  
3. 💡 The app will display whether the person is likely to have heart disease.  

## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Add support for additional ML algorithms for better accuracy.  
- 🎨 Enhance the web interface for a better user experience.  
- 📖 Provide detailed explanations of predictions.
